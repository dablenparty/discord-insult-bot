# The Discord Insult Bot

A bot that insults you

## How to use

Use this handy dandy [add link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=856385496581013534&permissions=2147503168&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
or find it in [add_link.txt](https://github.com/dablenparty/discord-insult-bot/blob/main/add_link.txt) and you're good
to go!

There is a 1 in 40 (ish, I'm not good at probability) chance that the bot will randomly insult a user after they send
a message. If you can't wait that long, you can utilize the slash command `/insult` and tag a friend to sick the bot on
them. If you're a fan of something the bot said, you can give 'em a high five with the `/highfive` command, or just tag
the bot with a hand emoji like üñêÔ∏è (replies also work).
