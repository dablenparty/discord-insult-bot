# discord-insult-bot

A bot that insults you

## How to use

Use this handy dandy [add link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=856385496581013534&permissions=2147503168&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
or find it in [add_link.txt](https://github.com/dablenparty/discord-insult-bot/blob/main/add_link.txt) and you're good
to go! 

There is a 1 in 30 chance that the bot will randomly insult a user after they send a message. If you can't wait that 
long, you can utilize the slash command `/insult` and tag a friend to sick the bot on them. Beware though, the bot
doesn't like to be tagged or replied to... it might turn on you.
